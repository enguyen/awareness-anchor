# Librarian Patterns - Awareness Anchor

Project-specific documentation organization rules for the Awareness Anchor macOS app.

---

## Documentation Lifecycle States

| State | Location | Description |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| **Active** | `docs/` or root | Currently relevant, may change |
| **Quick Reference** | Root (`STATUS.md`, `README.md`) | Entry points for context |
| **Archived Session** | `docs/archive/sessions/` | Completed session logs |
| **Design Spec** | `~/.claude/plans/` | Implementation plans (external) |

---

## Document Types and Placement

### Root Level
- `README.md` - Project overview, setup instructions, user-facing docs
- `STATUS.md` - Current project state, blockers, quick context for sessions
- `DEAD_ENDS.md` - Failed approaches to prevent repeat mistakes

### docs/ Directory
- Active design documents
- Feature specifications in progress
- Integration guides

### docs/archive/sessions/
- Session logs after session completion
- Named: `YYYY-MM-DD-session-log.md`
- Move here once session is complete and learnings captured in STATUS.md

### .claude/
- `settings.local.json` - Claude Code settings
- `.librarian_patterns.md` - This file

### External (User Home)
- `~/.claude/plans/` - Implementation plans (referenced by STATUS.md)
- `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md` - Cross-project development patterns

---

## Archive Triggers

Move documents to archive when:
1. Session is complete
2. Feature is fully implemented
3. Design decisions are finalized and captured in STATUS.md
4. Debug loops are documented in DEAD_ENDS.md

---

## Status Markers

| Marker | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| `[WORKING]` | Feature complete, functioning |
| `[BLOCKED]` | Has known blocker documented |
| `[DISABLED]` | Temporarily turned off |
| `[ ]` | Not started (roadmap item) |
| `[x]` | Completed |

---

## Session Documentation Workflow

1. **During session**: Take notes in `docs/YYYY-MM-DD-session-log.md`
2. **End of session**:
   - Update `STATUS.md` with current state and blockers
   - Add any dead ends to `DEAD_ENDS.md`
   - Move session log to `docs/archive/sessions/`
3. **Context compaction**: Use STATUS.md as primary context source

---

## Red Flags to Watch

- Session logs older than 3 days still in `docs/` (should be archived)
- STATUS.md not updated with latest blockers
- Debug loops not captured in DEAD_ENDS.md
- Duplicate information across STATUS.md and session logs

---

## Link Integrity

When moving files, search for references in:
- `README.md`
- `STATUS.md`
- `.claude/CLAUDE.md`

Update relative paths as needed.
